## Hi there! 👋🏻
### 💬 About me
🌿 I'm Daniel (you can call me Danny or Dan), a **Data Scientist** and a **NArFU student**. I am Pursuing my Bachelor in **Information Systems and Technologies** and will graduate in mid-2024. 🎓

📚 Outside the study and work, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. I am interested in minimalism, productivity, design. I like reading books on personal development & financial literacy. Also I’m fond of cinema, videogames and meditation. It helps me to relax. 🌱 

✈️ I like travelling. Every year I go on a trip to another city or country. 🥸
